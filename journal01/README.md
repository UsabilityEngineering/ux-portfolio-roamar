#### Journal 1: Out With The Old, In With The New
#### Rowelle Marino                   --- 07 March 2021

Ever since the pandemic started I’ve been using a lot more data since I’ve been staying at home. I went over the data cap with my internet provider a lot. So much to the point where it was better to pay for unlimited data, rather than paying for overages each month. 

So my goal was to get rid of my data cap. I called Comcast(Xfinity) and at the time, the only option to get unlimited data was to upgrade to this other package. So I did, and I had to get a new modem to opt into this package.

Now, my old modem looked like this:

A slim tower, which had a bunch of lights at the front, labeled with their function. These lights would indicate to me if my modem was powered on, if I currently had internet connection, if my telephone was connected (yes, landline, I know, yucky), etc. There was also this button at the top which would help connect a device easier.


The new modem they sent me looks like this:

It takes more of a square shape, and is also a tower. However, this modem does not have any lights on the front face, or any labeling telling me which functions are active. The only thing that indicates that it is powered on is a light at the top of the modem.

This small green area is the only light on the modem, and it’s even fainter in person. The first time I plugged it in, the light turned orange. I inferred that red/orange meant it was not functioning yet. I tried to see if I could connect to something on the internet, and my inference was correct. Red/orange meant that it was not ready yet. 

So I waited, because the person I had talked to on the phone told me that the first time setup might take a while. After a bit, the light turned green, and I assumed that it was all set, and everything was functioning correctly. When I tried to connect to the internet again, it still didn’t work. I found that odd, so I went on my phone and googled what the lights on the new modem meant. On Xfinity’s website, I found a chart which explains what each light means.

It became much clearer to me that my modem was not ready yet. Green fell into the “other color combinations” section, and my modem was still connecting. Eventually, my modem’s light turned into a white steady light. This means that it was either operational, or… had limited operation(?). I had no clue if everything was functioning correctly, but I could connect to the internet. As for my telephone, I would just have to hope that everything was operational.


Additionally, that button on the top of the old modem was moved to the back, in a slightly less visible position than the previous place (and you better remember that if you press it, the light will turn blue!)

The outcome was overall good; I got my new modem and now I have unlimited data. The setup confusion was not too bad, because it was essentially plug-and-play, and I just had to wait. However, the design of the modem was too simple for me to comprehend right away. I think the user experience of the old modem is better than the new one I have, so there was a tradeoff.

The **feedback** of both of these towers were the lights. Feedback refers to a signal from the technology that something is happening. However, I’d say that my old modem had a better feedback system, because there were multiple lights which were labeled for each function. The only feedback on the new modem was a single light, which turns different colors for different situations. There is no way to tell what is happening unless you look it up online (which you can’t do unless your internet is working) or by looking through the manual.

I would also say that the **memorability** of the new modem is not great. If a user interacts with your product, it should be easy to remember how to interact and understand it. However, if a user were to come back to the green light of the modem, they might fall for the same thing that I did, which is assume that the modem is fully functional. Also, if someone were to ask what light correlates with which function, I would not want to have to memorize the light combinations. (I haven’t ever seen my modem have a purple tint, but according to the chart they provide, it also means that the modem is fully functional, which is fairly confusing since it could also be in "other color combinations").

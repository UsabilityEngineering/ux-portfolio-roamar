#### Journal 2: Craigslist's User Interface Made Me *Switch* Off Their Website.
#### Rowelle Marino                   --- 02 May 2021

I had always wanted a Nintendo Switch, and with having to stay inside a lot of the time, I decided to pull the trigger a few months ago. However, most of the major retailers were sold out of them, and it would have been a while before they restocked. I decided to try other websites where I could order one at the suggested retail price (or lower) of the video game console.

My goal was to find a switch that I could get in my area. Craigslist was where I started my search. I had never used Craigslist before, but my friend told me about it and said it was a decent website. When I was met with the homepage, I was surprised to see that the website was super basic in its design.

Below is a picture of what the homepage for Craigslist looks like.

It confused me, because I had heard a lot of things about this website, and thought the design would be more pleasant. Honestly, it made me concerned about the **safety** of the website. In my experience, websites that don't seem to put effort into their design are usually not very safe. 

However, I decided to push on, because even though the design of the website was very basic, there still seemed to be a lot of content on the pages. The way I found the section where the Switch would be was through **satisficing**. Satisficing is finding the first option that might satisfy what you're searching for on the website. There were a lot of headings and sub-headings on the page, and everything was in blue text, indicating that almost everything on the page was clickable. This was overwhelming to me. As I quickly skimmed the website, I looked to the "For Sale" heading and found the category for video games.

It brought me to a page that showed things related to video games, where there was a search bar. In the search bar, I typed "Nintendo Switch," and pressed enter. The results were underwhelming. There weren't many options, and half of them were just advertisements for things not pertaining to a Nintendo Switch (see image below). The other results were located in places that were not near my area, and would be inconvenient.

At this point I realized that this website was not going to help me in my end goal of getting a Nintendo Switch. It possibly could have, but I was just about done with this website. It was neither **effective** nor **satisfying** to use. I could not get to my end goal without having to struggle through the unappealing design.

After going through the experience with Craigslist, I moved onto Ebay. I had a much easier time finding my way to a Nintendo Switch on this website. The searchbar was at the top, and there were actually pictures on the homepage. In the searchbar, when I typed in "Nintendo Switch," there was an option to search specifically in Video Game Consoles.

I hit search, and there were many more options for me to choose from. There were options to refine my search such as "Buy It Now" and putting in a certain price range. I inputted the "Buy It Now" filter as well as a price range from $250-$310. Within a couple of minutes I found a switch that I could get shipped to me at MSRP.

Ebay's site was **effective** and **satisfying**, unlike Craigslist. I found what I was looking for in much less time. I will say that Craigslist's site is probably more interpersonal than Ebay's site from what I gathered, so it might not have been the best website to try finding a Switch on, since it relies on other people putting up listings in certain areas. However, the satisfaction of using Craigslist is not great because of it's very basic and lackluster design. Everything is plain, all the text is blue and it did not follow many conventions and heuristics(specifically aesthetic design) of other websites. Overall, a bad user experience that could be improved by creating a more aesthetic design and following some heuristics of website design. I would also recommend finding a way to stop advertisements about things that are not the product from showing up in the search results.

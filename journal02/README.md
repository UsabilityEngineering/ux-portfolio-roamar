#### Journal 2: Craigslist's User Interface Made Me *Switch* Off Their Website.
#### Rowelle Marino                   --- 02 May 2021

I had always wanted a Nintendo Switch, and with having to stay inside a lot of the time, I decided to pull the trigger a few months ago. However, most of the major retailers were sold out of them, and it would have been a while before they restocked. I decided to try other websites where I could order one at the suggested retail price (or lower) of the video game console.

My goal was to find a switch that I could get in my area. Craigslist was where I started my search. I had never used Craigslist before, but my friend told me about it and said it was a decent website. When I was met with the homepage, I was surprised to see that the website was super basic in its design.

Below is a picture of what the homepage for Craigslist looks like.

It confused me, because I had heard a lot of things about this website, and thought the design would be more pleasant. Honestly, it made me concerned about the **safety** of the website. In my experience, websites that don't seem to put effort into their design are usually not very safe. 

However, I decided to push on, because even though the design of the website was very basic, there still seemed to be a lot of content on the pages. The way I found the section where the Switch would be was through **satisficing**. Satisficing is finding the first option that might satisfy what you're searching for on the website. There were a lot of headings and sub-headings on the page, and everything was in blue text, indicating that almost everything on the page was clickable. This was overwhelming to me. As I quickly skimmed the website, I looked to the "For Sale" heading and found the category for video games.

It brought me to a page that showed things related to video games, where there was a search bar. In the search bar, I typed "Nintendo Switch," and pressed enter. The results were underwhelming. There weren't many options, and half of them were just advertisements for things not pertaining to a Nintendo Switch.
